One of the significant challenges was translating mathematical equations into low-level instructions while achieving accurate results. Unlike high-level programming languages, assembly demands a strong grasp of processor operations, memory conceptions, and register usage. Debugging posed another difficulty, as debugging logical errors required careful stepwise analysis using GDB. Extra caution was given to ensuring each instruction did the intended operation with negative values and multiplication, especially regarding data types and sign handling. The cycle of assembling, linking, and debugging each equation's program over and over stressed precision and thorough testing. These challenges complemented the learning process of how computers do arithmetic operations at a hardware level and proved the importance of careful planning and verification in low-level programming.
